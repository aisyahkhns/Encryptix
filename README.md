<h2> Internship Tasks at Encryptix </h2>

This folder contains internship tasks completed at Encryptix, showcasing implementations of various Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and systems. The tasks are organized into separate Jupyter Notebooks for ease of execution and demonstration.

1. Simple Chatbot

This project explores the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot:
	•	Answers common questions.
	•	Performs basic text processing such as tokenization and pattern matching.
	•	Provides insights into the workings of text-based systems.

Notebook: chatbot.ipynb
Technologies Used:
	•	Python
	•	Regex for pattern matching
	•	NLTK for tokenization (optional)

2. Tic Tac Toe Agent

This project implements an AI agent for the Tic Tac Toe game using:
	•	Minimax Algorithm: Ensures optimal decisions at every step.
	•	Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimizes Minimax by reducing the number of nodes evaluated.

Notebook: tic_tac_toe.ipynb
Features:
	•	Allows you to play Tic Tac Toe against the AI agent.
	•	The AI agent is designed to never lose.

Technologies Used:
	•	Python
	•	Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms

3. Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a recommendation system using the Netflix Dataset to explore:
	•	Content-Based Filtering: Recommendations based on movie categories, age ratings, and durations.
	•	Collaborative Filtering: Recommendations based on user interactions with movies.
	•	Hybrid Recommendation: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for improved relevance.

Notebook: movie_recommender.ipynb
Features:
	•	Processes the Netflix dataset for cleaning and preparation.
	•	Generates movie recommendations based on a specific movie.
	•	Utilizes algorithms like TF-IDF, cosine similarity, and SVD.

Technologies Used:
	•	Python
	•	Jupyter Notebook
	•	Scikit-learn
	•	Pandas & NumPy

How to Run
	1.	Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	2.	Open the respective Jupyter Notebook file in your preferred environment (e.g., JupyterLab, VSCode):
	•	chatbot.ipynb for the Chatbot task.
	•	tic_tac_toe.ipynb for the Tic Tac Toe Agent.
	•	movie_recommender.ipynb for the Movie Recommendation System.
	3.	Execute the cells in sequence to observe the results.

Notes

These Jupyter Notebooks are designed for hands-on exploration of AI and NLP concepts. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out.
